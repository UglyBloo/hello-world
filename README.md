High i am retired due to cancer. I would have retired two years ago any way but had to finish a couple of years early. Was an aircraft engine fitter for twenty years then did hydraulics for 15 years, and finished as a TAFE teacher till I retired. Now I drive my wife crazy with my projects that I do.
